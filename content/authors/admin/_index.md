I am Houssem Menhour, currently studying Computer Engineering at Kocaeli University with a focus on Data Science and Machine Learning. I program mostly in C++ and Python, but recently started picking interest in Go and Scala as well.

This is a space where I share some random thoughts, and write about interesting projects and topics in my field.
