I am Houssem Menhour, a Computer Vision Engineer at Visiomex where I build industrial quality control and automation systems. Before that I have worked on a variety of topics while pursuing my Computer Engineering degree at Kocaeli University, including Autonomous Vehicles, Distributed Systems, Stream Processing and Big Data Analytics. I program mostly in C++, C# and Python, but recently started picking interest in Go and Rust as well.

This is a space where I share some random thoughts, and write about interesting projects and topics in my field.
