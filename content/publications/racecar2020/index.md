abstract: " As autonomous cars and complex features of them grow in popularity, ensuring that analyses and capabilities are reproducible and repeatable has taken on importance in education plans too. This paper describes a reproducible research plan on mini autonomous race car programming. This educational plan is designed and implemented as part of a summer internship program at Kocaeli University and it consists of theoretical courses and laboratory assignments. A literate programming approach with the Python language is used for programming the race car. To assess the educational program's impact on the learning process and to evaluate the acceptance and satisfaction level of students, they answered an electronic questionnaire after finishing the program. According to students' feedback, the reproducible educational program is useful for learning and consolidating new concepts of mini autonomous car programming."
