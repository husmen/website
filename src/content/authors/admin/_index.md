I am Houssem Menhour, currently doing a MSc in Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Oulu, with a focus on AI. Prior to that, I worked for 2+ years as a Computer Vision Engineer at [Visiomex](https://visiomex.com/) where I built industrial quality control and automation systems.

I program mostly in C++, C# and Python. And I would love to combine my studies with a new professional challenge in a CV/ML related role.  

This is a space where I (plan to) write about interesting projects, topics and random thoughts.
