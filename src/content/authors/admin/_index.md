I am Houssem Menhour, currently doing a MSc in Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Oulu, with a focus on AI. and I would love to combine that with a new professional challenge in a CV/ML related role. Prior to that, I worked for 2+ years as a Computer Vision Engineer at Visiomex where I built industrial quality control and automation systems. During my bachelor's degree at Kocaeli University, I worked on various topics including Autonomous Vehicles, Distributed Systems, Stream Processing and Big Data Analytics. I program mostly in C++, C# and Python, but recently started picking interest in Go and Rust as well.

This is a space where I share some random thoughts, and write about interesting projects and topics in my field.
